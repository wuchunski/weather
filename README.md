### Assessment:
* Implement an HTML-based weather application, capable of showing the current temperature & five day forecast
* Ability to auto-detect the user's location, or have them manually select it
* Ability to switch between degrees C & F
* Ideally built out of Angular.js 1.x or Angular 2+
* Responsive layout suitable to iPad/iPhone, portrait+landscape
* The goal is to assess both your ability to write well-structured code as well as assemble a decent UI and front end without explicit guidance on requirements.
